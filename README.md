# AWS CDK: Environment Context Experimental Feature

**This is an experiment** to increase ease-of-use of `cdk` within CI/CD. We'll see. Using the here provide `App` will make any environment variables with the prefix `CDK_CONTEXT_` available in the [context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/context.html). The name in the context does not contain the prefix, e.g. from `CDK_CONTEXT_someVar` will be available with `const someVar = this.node.tryGetContext("someVar")`. The prefix can be modified in the `AppProps`.

**Limitation:** CDK internal context keys like "@aws-cdk/core:bootstrapQualifier" cannot be provided due to character limitations of environment variable names, which are: `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`. Could be solved with intermediate encoding, but seems like too much complexity in usage, for cases that could (and should?) be used via `cdk.json` or `cdk.context.json` and likely also better `--context`.

**Use Case**: CustomResources for CloudFormation that is implemented as Lambda and/or ECS task that executes `cdk deploy`, `cdk destroy` etc. Context parameters are provided by environment or secrets anyway.

## Usage

**Note:** The created NPM package is hosted on [Github packages](https://github.com/features/packages) as I do not consider it production ready and do not want to contribute to accidental installsâ€¦ Read up how to [use Github Packages hosted NPM packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/guides/configuring-npm-for-use-with-github-packages#installing-a-package) if you want to use it.

in your `bin/file.ts`:

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env node
import 'source-map-support/register';
import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core';
import { App } from '@ukautz/aws-cdk-envcontext';
import { YourStack } from '../lib/your-stack';

// use app from envcontext
const app = new App();
new YourStack(app, 'YourStack');
```

Assuming the following environment variablse:

```
CDK_CONTEXT_myVar=foo
CDK_CONTEXT_otherVar=bar
```

Then in `lib/your-stack.ts`:

```typescript
import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core';
import { App } from '@ukautz/aws-cdk-envcontext';

export interface ExampleStackProps extends cdk.StackProps, envcontext.StackProps {}

export class ExampleStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: ExampleStackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // access context injected from env
    this.node.tryGetContext('myVar')

    // access App's Environment (or throw error if missing)
    const someVar = App.envOf(this).must('someVar');

    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'Vars', {
      value: `myVar = ${myVar}, someVar = ${someVar}`, // will contain 'myVar = foo, someVar = bar'
    });
  }
}
```

Then in the command line:

```shell
$ export CDK_CONTEXT_foo=bar
$ cdk synth
```

The rendered CloudFormation YAML should contain:

```yaml
Outputs:
  Output:
    Value: bar
```

### Common environment concerns

Example

```typescript
import { App } from '@ukautz/aws-cdk-envcontext';
import { YourStack } from '../lib/your-stack';

// use app from envcontext
const app = new App();

// throw Error on missing environment variables
app.env.require('myVar', 'otherVar');

// get a single environment variable
const myVar = app.env.must('myVar'); // throws Error if missing
const someVar = app.env.may('someVar', 'default'); // returns default if not present

// get all env vars, with given defaults
const env = app.env.all({ someVar: 'default' });
```

## Useful commands

- `npm run build` compile typescript to js
- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
